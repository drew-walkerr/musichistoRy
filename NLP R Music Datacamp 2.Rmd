This is part Two-B of a three-part tutorial series in which you will continue to use R to perform a variety of analytic tasks on a case study of musical lyrics by the legendary artist Prince, as well as other artists and authors. The three tutorials cover the following:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidytext) #text mining, unnesting
#install.packages("topicmodels")
library(topicmodels) #the LDA algorithm
library(tidyr) #gather()
library(dplyr) #awesome tools
library(ggplot2) #visualization
library(kableExtra) #create attractive tables
library(knitr) #simple table generator
library(ggrepel) #text and label geoms for ggplot2
library(gridExtra)
library(formattable) #color tile and color bar in `kables`
library(tm) #text mining
#install.packages("circlize")
